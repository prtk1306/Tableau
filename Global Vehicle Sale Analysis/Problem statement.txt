This project mainly deals with the data preparation part, wherein the data we have in the below link is more appealing for human eyes, in short, a report format, but we need to modify the data per the machine-readable form, like, we need a single column for every Dimension and Measures. Follow the steps below to convert the data from human-readable to machine-understandable structure format.

1) Add a new column named Region.
2) Remove rows showing the total for each region from the below dataset.
3) Remove empty columns/rows.
4) Remove extra text above and below the main data.
5) Save and Import the data in Tableau.
6) Select Data Interpreter checkbox, a very handy functionality in Tableau, which is used to clean an Excel sheet on its own.
7) Convert all the year columns into a single column using Pivot functionality in Tableau.
8) Change the Column Names at your convenience.

The data is ready for use.

Create a worksheet using the above-modified data showing the number of vehicles sold every year globally. Show the sales using the map plot as well. Apply filters wherever necessary.
